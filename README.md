# Monty Hall Simulation Problem

This Python program simulates the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle that demonstrates a counterintuitive result in probability theory. The simulation allows users to explore the outcomes of sticking with their initial choice versus switching doors after one non-prize door is revealed.

## Understanding the Monty Hall Problem

In the Monty Hall problem, a contestant is presented with three doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two doors are goats. After the contestant chooses a door, the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat. The contestant is then given the option to stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door. The simulation shows that switching doors increases the chances of winning the car.

## Features

- Simulate the game show scenario with random door assignments.
- Allow the contestant to choose a door and decide whether to stick or switch after a goat is revealed.
- Run multiple iterations to gather statistical data on the outcomes.
- Compare the win rates of sticking versus switching strategies.

## How to Run the Simulation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system, then clone the repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/monty-hall-simulation.git
cd monty-hall-simulation
python monty_hall_simulation.py
